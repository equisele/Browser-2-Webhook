        <p><b>Browser 2 Webhook</b> will allow you to send some information that you are browsing – as well as its title
            and meta description,
            if it has any – to a webhook from <b>Automation tools</b> such as <span id="make">Make</span>, Zapier,
            Integrately, <span id="airtable">Airtable</span> n8n, <span id="ifttt">IFTTT</span> and many more. In this way you
            can automate processes
            that are related to the web page you are visiting.</p>
        <p>All you need is to replace the url you are seeing right now with one belonging to the automation tools
            mentioned above and save it by clicking the "Save" button.</p>
        <p>Another major benefit is that Chrome's synced local storage is used; therefore, if you switch to another
            device, you will have the webhook url available.</p>
        <p><b>Important:</b> <em>only following domains and paths</em> are allowed to send POST requests:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>https://hook.eu1.make.com/*</li>
